                        It is based on data collected from both public and private sources, including the District and Federal

                            <p>Spring is a time for new growth, but before we look forward toward reaching our 40 percent tree 
                                canopy goal, we must look back. The Casey Trees annual Tree Report Card reviews and highlights 
                                the successes of our previous year and calls attention to where we can do more. I am happy to 
                                report that our tree canopy has continued to improve; we exceeded our tree planting goals and a 
                                majority of the trees in the District are still in good or excellent health. However, many of our 
                                trees are still at constant risk for removal and we continue to see impervious surfaces dominate our
                                landscape.
                            </p>
                            <p>The theme for this year’s Tree Report Card is Empowering Future Generations Through Trees. To grow 
                                a greater, greener city, we must work together, not just today or tomorrow, but day after day and 
                                year after year. When we  teach younger generations about the value of trees and green space now, 
                                we will ensure that our city’s lush tree filled legacy continues.

                            <p>It is essential that younger generations feel vested to protect their trees and green space which
                                happens when they feel a connection to it. Connecting with the environment and finding value in 
                                it can be done in many different ways, but it all starts with going outside. Providing children, 
                                a place where they can interact with their local environment is important, but they cannot do this
                                if there is not a healthy and comfortable space to do it. Trees can create these spaces.
                            </p>
                            <p>Our trees are one of our city’s most valuable resources. It can take generations for a tree to grow 
                                to maturity, but only a moment for it to be cut down. When a large tree is removed, it can significantly 
                                impact an entire community, not just because of the environmental benefits lost, but because of the 
                                intrinsic value trees bring. If we are going to continue to protect our trees from illegal removal,
                                we must make sure that kids are getting a chance to interact with them and experience, not only the 
                                aesthetic value they provide, but also the social and health benefits that come with having a strong 
                                and vibrant urban environment.

                            <p>Playgrounds are a place for kids to experience their local environment through outdoor activities. 
                                Unfortunately, on a hot summer day, the urban heat island effect makes the plastic and concrete 
                                that these spaces are made of extremely hot and ultimately unusable. Maintaining trees and green 
                                spaces around play structures creates a cool and welcoming environment that kids are comfortable 
                                playing in.

                <p>The Tree Report Card rates Washington, D.C.’s urban forest based on four metrics: Tree Coverage, Tree Health,
                    Tree Planting and Tree Protection. Each one of these metrics is evaluated and given a letter grade. The 
                    overall grade for the District’s tree canopy is the average of these scores. This year, the average grade
                    for the District’s tree canopy is an A-.

                                and species are used to determine its overall health. This information reflects how resilient the 
                                canopy can be when faced with pests and disease. Every five years, Casey Trees evaluates the 
                                District’s tree health. This is done by surveying 201 sites across the District and assessing 
                                the health of the trees on these plots of land.

                            at least 10,648 trees must be planted each year. We have surpassed this number for the last 5 years. For this reason, Tree

                                <br />Using the Consumer Price Index, we can see that inflation from 2016 to 2019 increased the Special Tree Removal Permit fee from $55 per inch 
                                circumference to $59.66. Per inch, this is not a significant difference. However, increasing this fee to meet inflation would have resulted in $140,779.58

                                <br />The Urban Forest Preservation Act states that the money collected from the Special Tree Removal Permit fees and illegal tree removal 
                                fines must be used to plant trees on public and private land. This money continues to be used for this purpose. Therefore,

                                <br />Tree survival data shows us that two out of every ten trees planted in an urban setting grow to Special tree size. The amount of money that is received
                                for every Special tree removed is enough to plant 10 new trees.  At least 2 of those ten trees planted will survive and grow to become mature special tree sized.

                    <span style="font-weight:900;">Tree Coverage</span> is a measure of a tree’s crown when viewed from above and is the way we track the progress that the District makes towards its 40 percent tree canopy by 2032 goal.  The tree crown or canopy produces most of the trees overall benefits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span style="font-weight:900;">Tree Health</span> encompasses trees condition, species, size and type. This metric helps us understand
                    how resilient the District’s trees are in terms of potential threats due to pests and diseases. It can
                    also predict the longevity and future composition of D.C.’s trees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span style="font-weight:900;">Tree Planting</span> is a count of annual tree planting numbers compared to the total number of trees
                    that must be planted per year to achieve the city’s 40 percent canopy goal by 2032.</p>
                <p>
                    <span style="font-weight:900;">Tree Protection</span> assesses the impact of the Urban Forestry Preservation Act of 2002, and the Tree
                    Canopy Protection Amendment Act of 2016. These laws are intended to slow the removal of healthy trees
                    44 - 100 inches in circumference and ensure their replacement when they are cut down. Additionally, they
                    prohibit the removal of trees over 100 inches in circumference unless granted special approval by the
                    Mayor.
